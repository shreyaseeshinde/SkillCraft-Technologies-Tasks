Distribution Visualization Project
This project focuses on visualizing the distribution of categorical and continuous variables using bar charts and histograms. Specifically, it includes visualizations such as the distribution of ages and genders within a population dataset.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Explore the distribution of categorical variables, such as gender.
Explore the distribution of continuous variables, such as age.
Create visualizations to better understand the underlying patterns in the data.
Visualizations
1. Bar Charts
Description: Bar charts were used to visualize the distribution of categorical variables like gender. The bars represent the frequency or count of each category.
Example: A bar chart showing the number of males and females in the dataset.
2. Histograms
Description: Histograms were employed to display the distribution of continuous variables such as age. The data was divided into intervals, with each bar representing the frequency of data points within that interval.
Example: A histogram showing the age distribution across the population.
Data Used
Dataset: The project uses a sample dataset containing demographic information, including age and gender.
Data Source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL
Tools & Libraries
Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For creating bar charts and histograms.
